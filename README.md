# What was done so far? #

07.04.2019 
We can move around a camera. Basic visual (simple 3D plane).

# Future road map #

0) Minimal experiment (moving camera, selecting buildings)
1) porting the base of the game to Godot (ability to create pipes and nodes) 
2) adding natural disasters (storms, alien invasion and quakes) 
3) using existing art to finalize the prototype 

# FAQ #

## Can I contribute?
Yes, you are welcome especially on the scripting part

## Why redoing it in Godot. Isn't just updating the existing game easier?
While the original game was written in python, not using a game engine makes it really hard to expand it and focus on the game. 

Godot is a proven game engine which reduce the overhead of figuring out how to create particles, camera management, scene structure etc. It also opens up to potential future visual improvements.

## Can I play it?
WARNING. This version is not yet ready for general release. It is 
not a complete game. Currently if you want to play it's easier to use the original 2006 version.

## What is the license?
It is avaliable under GPL just like the original game.
