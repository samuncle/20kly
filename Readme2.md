This project is a remake of 20,000 Light Years Into Space using the Godot Game Engine

# What was done so far? #

07.04.2019 
We can move around a camera. Basic visual (simple 3D plane).

# road map #

1) porting the base of the game to Godot (ability to create pipes and nodes) 
2) adding natural disasters (storms, alien invasion and quakes) 
3) using existing art to finalize the prototype 

# FAQ #

> Can I contribute?
Yes, you are welcome especially on the scripting part

> Why redoing it in Godot. Isn't just updating the existing game easier?
While the original game was written in python, not using a game engine makes it really hard to expand it and focus on the game. 

Godot is a proven game engine which reduce the overhead of figuring out how to create particles, camera management, scene structure etc. It also opens up to potential future visual improvements.
