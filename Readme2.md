this is a remake of 20,000 Light Years Into Space, made with the Godot game engine. 


# road map #

1) porting the base of the game to Godot (ability to create pipes and nodes) 
2) adding natural disasters (storms, alien invasion and quakes) 
3) using existing art to finalize the prototype 

# why not using the existing python code ? #

While the original game was written in python, not using a game engine makes it really hard to expand it and focus on the game. 

Godot is a proven game engine which helps to setup a prototype. It also opens up to potential visual improvements
